    b - ball (coin, brick, spike, canon, etc.)
    c - UI (start, pause, score, restart)

2 - Features
    b - start screen (select character, ready button, start button)
    c - wait for second before the game start
    d - change the score to a manche score (player win at 3)

3 - Super Features
    a - ball chosen changes its behaviour (faster, slower, bouncy, sticky, etc.)
    b - player changes the properties of the paddle (larger, stronger, etc.)
    c - after each change, a roulette is launched changing the ball for the game.
